Immediately after you disappear, a thunderous boom sounds, and each creature within 10 feet of the space you left must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 elemental damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away.\n\tYou can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell, and there must be an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your destination space for the creature to appear in; otherwise, the creature is left behind.\n\t**Enhance Spell**. For each 1300 additional mana spent on this spell, add 1d10 to the spell damage, up to 3d10 extra damage.",
