Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared away. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.\n\t**Enhance Spell**. For each extra 1400 mana spent, the damage increases by 1d12, up to 3d12 extra damage.",
