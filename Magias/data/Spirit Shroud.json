The spirits are intangible and invulnerable.\n\tUntil the spell ends, any attack you make deals 1d8 extra shadow damage when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you. Any creature that takes this damage can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn.\n\t In addition, any creature of your choice that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.\n\t**Enhance Spell**. For each 1000 extra mana spent on this spell, add 1d8 up to 3d8 additional damage.",
